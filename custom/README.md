## Introduction
    Haptic Engine encapsulates Huawei's linear motor vibration capability into open APIs for developers to customize vibration waveforms and orchestrate services.

​	Haptic Engine enables Huawei smartphones, popular applications, and games and entertainment products to use Huawei-developed linear motors to customize vibration waveforms, creating optimal vibration experience for consumers.

## Getting Started

1. Check whether the Android studio development environment is ready. Open the sample code project directory with file "build.gradle" in Android Studio. Run TestApp on your device or simulator which have installed latest Huawei Mobile Service(HMS).
2. Register a [HUAWEI account](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/).
3. Create an app and configure the app information in AppGallery Connect.
