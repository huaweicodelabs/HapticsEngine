## Introduction
    Haptics Kit encapsulates Huawei's self-developed linear motor vibration capability into an open interface that is convenient for developers to use. It can help developers quickly implement Huawei's self-developed linear motor vibration capability in applications.
   	Haptics Kit enables Huawei smartphones, mass applications, and gaming entertainment to use Huawei's self-developed linear motor vibration capability to create the best vibration experience for consumers.

## Getting Started

   1. Check whether the Android studio development environment is ready. Open the sample code project directory with file "build.gradle" in Android Studio. Run TestApp on your device or simulator which have installed latest Huawei Mobile Service(HMS).
   2. Register a [HUAWEI account](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/).
   3. Create an app and configure the app information in AppGallery Connect.
